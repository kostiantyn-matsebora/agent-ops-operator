# pipeline-model

## Purpose

The Pipeline CRD: a credential-free wiring layer binding N signal sources and M channels to one profile, and the SOLE source of its conversations' capabilities (mode-less `toolsets`/`mcpConfigs` refs) — with pipeline-only routing resolution, and at-most-one-pipeline-per-source claiming.

## Requirements

### Requirement: Pipeline CRD declares the wiring between sources, channels, and a profile
The `Pipeline` CRD SHALL bind N `signalSourceRefs` and M `channelRefs` to one `profileRef`: signals from every referenced source SHALL become conversations bound to ALL referenced channels with the pipeline's profile, and conversations originated from any referenced channel SHALL be bound to all referenced channels. The Pipeline SHALL also be the SOLE source of its conversations' capabilities, via two optional stanzas of ordered refs: `spec.toolsets` (→ `MCPToolset` CRs, the allowlist) and `spec.mcpConfigs` (→ `MCPConfig` CRs, the MCP servers). Neither carries a mode and neither has a default — a Pipeline that declares no bindings gives its conversations no capabilities, and nothing supplies them elsewhere. A Pipeline SHALL be ADDRESSABLE by name: the task API creates a conversation against a named Pipeline, taking its profile, channel set, and capabilities from it. A Pipeline with neither sources nor channels carries no special meaning; it is simply a route nothing feeds. The Pipeline SHALL carry no credentials, no server or tool definitions, and no runtime selection (runtime stays `profile.runtimeRef → "default"`). A reconciler SHALL maintain a `Ready` condition (all references resolve, including toolset and mcpConfig refs) without creating any workload.

#### Scenario: Signals fan out to every pipeline channel
- **WHEN** a Pipeline binds source `alertmanager` to channels `home-ops` and `web` and an alert fires
- **THEN** the resulting conversation carries channel bindings for both `home-ops` and `web` and uses the pipeline's profile

#### Scenario: Chat-originated conversations are pipeline-bound
- **WHEN** a user starts a conversation on a channel referenced by a Pipeline
- **THEN** the conversation is bound to all the Pipeline's channels, not just the originating one

#### Scenario: Dangling references surface on Ready
- **WHEN** a Pipeline references a SignalSource that does not exist
- **THEN** the Pipeline reports `Ready=False` naming the missing reference

#### Scenario: Capabilities bind per route
- **WHEN** two Ready Pipelines route to the same profile with different `toolsets`
- **THEN** conversations from each carry exactly that Pipeline's tools, and the profile declares none

#### Scenario: A Pipeline is addressable by name
- **WHEN** the task API names a Ready Pipeline
- **THEN** the created conversation uses that Pipeline's profile, channel set, and capabilities

#### Scenario: A sourceless, channelless Pipeline is unremarkable
- **WHEN** a Pipeline names only a `profileRef` and capability stanzas
- **THEN** it is a route nothing feeds — addressable by the task API like any other, and carrying no per-profile default meaning

#### Scenario: Dangling tooling ref surfaces on Ready
- **WHEN** a Pipeline's `toolsets.refs` or `mcpConfigs.refs` names a CR that does not exist
- **THEN** the Pipeline reports `Ready=False` naming the missing reference

### Requirement: Pipeline-only resolution
Routing SHALL resolve wiring exclusively through Ready Pipelines: a source's signals route via the pipeline that claims it (unclaimed sources drop signals with a visible reason and a `Wired=False` condition). This applies uniformly to every source kind, INCLUDING chat sources — a conversation originated by a general-surface chat message resolves through the Pipeline claiming that chat `SignalSource`, exactly as an alert resolves through the Pipeline claiming its alert source.

A `Channel` SHALL NOT supply a default profile, and inbound resolution SHALL NOT fall back to pipeline creation order: the previous "oldest Ready Pipeline referencing this channel" tiebreak is REMOVED, because origination no longer happens on a channel. Channels remain shareable across Pipelines for delivery and mirroring, unaffected. Thread replies continue to resolve through the conversation's own thread binding, independent of any pipeline lookup.

A `/<name> <task>` chat command SHALL address a PIPELINE by name — the Pipeline originates the conversation, so it supplies the profile AND the capabilities; addressing a profile would name something with no wiring and therefore nothing to grant. The agent listing SHALL enumerate Ready Pipelines rather than profiles, so it advertises only names a user can actually address. No CR other than `Pipeline` carries standing wiring; `Conversation` fields are materialized per-conversation state, not wiring.

#### Scenario: Unclaimed source routes nothing
- **WHEN** a signal arrives for a source no Ready Pipeline references
- **THEN** no conversation is created, the response says so, and the source shows `Wired=False`

#### Scenario: Unclaimed chat source routes nothing
- **WHEN** a general-surface chat message arrives for a chat source no Ready Pipeline claims
- **THEN** no conversation is created, the source shows `Wired=False`, and the drop reason reaches the originating surface

#### Scenario: A command addresses a pipeline and gets its capabilities
- **WHEN** a user sends `/some-pipeline do it` on a channel
- **THEN** the conversation uses that Pipeline's profile and carries its toolsets and mcpConfigs, rather than being created with none

#### Scenario: Commands work through the chat source
- **WHEN** a user sends `/some-pipeline do it` on a channel whose chat source is claimed
- **THEN** a conversation is created for that Pipeline through the signal path, bound to the originating channel

#### Scenario: The listing advertises only addressable names
- **WHEN** a user asks for the agent listing
- **THEN** it names Ready Pipelines, not AgentProfiles — a profile name cannot be addressed

#### Scenario: Bare message resolves through the claiming pipeline
- **WHEN** a non-command message arrives on a channel's general surface
- **THEN** the conversation uses the profile of the Pipeline claiming the chat source and is bound to all that Pipeline's channels

#### Scenario: Shared channels need no tiebreak
- **WHEN** two Ready Pipelines both reference channel `web` for delivery
- **THEN** neither ordering nor creation timestamps affect inbound resolution, because neither claims origination on it

#### Scenario: Replies bypass pipeline resolution entirely
- **WHEN** a user replies inside an existing thread
- **THEN** the input is appended to that thread's conversation with no pipeline lookup

### Requirement: One pipeline per source
A SignalSource SHALL be claimed by at most one Pipeline: when a second Pipeline references an already-claimed source, the newer Pipeline SHALL report `SourceConflict=True` naming the contested source and the older claim SHALL keep routing. Channels MAY be referenced by multiple Pipelines; a conversation's binding set comes from the pipeline that originates it, and inbound on a multi-pipeline channel originates via the oldest Ready claimant (deterministic).

#### Scenario: Second claim on a source is refused
- **WHEN** two Pipelines reference the same SignalSource
- **THEN** the newer reports `SourceConflict=True` and the source's signals keep routing per the older Pipeline

#### Scenario: Channel shared by two pipelines stays valid
- **WHEN** two Ready Pipelines both reference channel `web`
- **THEN** neither reports a conflict, and each pipeline's sources produce conversations bound per their own pipeline
